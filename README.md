# CCM_finalProject

This project is investigating the perceptual magnect effect in short-term memory for orientation. We built a Bayesian model to understand the bias toward coordinates.

The Task folder includes the code for this orientation WM task.
To run the task, open Matlab and run task.m
Input subject number (e.g., 1) and run number (e.g., 1).
Normally, each subject only needs to do 1 run. In case you meet some problems during the task, you can use another run number for the subject to collect new data.
Each run has 160 trials, which will take around 20mins in total.


The task_procedure.pptx illustrades the task procedure.
